                    The internet is full of information about baking sourdough bread.
                    If you read too much it can get overwhelming quickly, since everyone has different advice (and it usually contradicts someone else's advice!)
                    <p>
                    Sourdough is pretty resilient. I've neglected my starter in the fridge for months at a time, left dough proofing overnight by accident, and made lots of mistakes. Don't worry about advice about flour types, special equipment, filtered water, etc. Use what you have on hand. You can optimize those things once you're comfortable with a basic recipe.
                    Do what's easiest for you and experiment a lot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The biggest factor with dough is temperature. On warm days the dough will rise quickly, on cold days it will rise slowly.
                    Take the timing from recipies as a suggestion, but pay attention to what your dough is doing. When the dough has doubled in size you're ready to move on to shaping the loaf. If you need more time you can even move the dough to the fridge overnight and start again tomorrow.

                      This page has good instructions on keeping your starter fed and happy. When I want to bake a loaf of bread I take my starter out of the fridge in the morning and mix the dough a couple hours later once the starter has warmed up and is active. I feed the starter and immediately put it back in the fridge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Starter is fine in the fridge for weeks or even months at a time- you just might need to feed it a couple times over a day or two to bring it back to life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Don't throw out your sourdough starter discard! Keep it in a jar in the fridge and use it to make <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe">panackes</a> or <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-crumpets-recipe">crumpets</a> or <a href="https://www.breadexperience.com/sourdough-rosemary-lavash-crackers/">rosemary crackers</a>

                <p class="mb-0">
                    This is the recipe that finally really worked for me. Ignore the bits about strong bread flour (add it if you have it, but you don't need it!). Most "no knead" bread recipes involve getting your dutch oven super hot and then trying to drop your loaf into it without getting burned somehow. Elaine's recipe lets you use a cold dutch oven (you can start baking in a cold oven) which makes the whole process a lot less stressful and error prone.

                  Equipment
              </div>
              <div class="tm-portfolio-description">
                You can find lots of specialized equipment for baking bread, but most of it isn't necessary until you've been baking a while. Start with the tools you have. There are only three tools that are essential:
                <h3 class="tm-text-dark-gray">
                <br>
                    Scale
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0">
                A kitchen scale is the most important part of baking. Flour can vary in volume depending on the humidity or the type of flour you're using. The only way to make sure you're consistently mixing the right amount of flour and water together is to weigh it. I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ozeri-Professional-Digital-Kitchen-Tempered/dp/B003MSZBSI">this kitchen scale</a> but any scale that can do from 0-2kg will be fine.
                </p>

                <h3 class="tm-text-dark-gray">
                <br>
                   Dutch Oven 
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0">
                Steam is important during baking. It keeps the crust soft so that the loaf of bread can rise while it bakes, which makes the inside light and fluffy. Professional bakers have ovens that inject steam during baking, but that's hard to set up in a home oven. 
                <br>
                A dutch oven is a great way to emulate a steamed oven- the steam from the baking loaf gets trapped in the small container and it creates a perfect loaf without any effort. You'll want a dutch oven that's approximately 5 quarts. I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LEXR0K">this dutch oven</a> because the loaf can sit in the lid which makes it easy to put in and take out of the oven.
                </p>

                 <h3 class="tm-text-dark-gray">
                <br>
                   Large Container
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0">
                You'll need a large container to mix the dough in. This isn't strictly necessary- you can use a large mixing bowl, but you'll have to scale your recipes to fit inside the bowl. Remember that the dough will double in size (or more!) during proofing.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                A 6 quart container is just the right size for me. It can handle two loaves worth of dough at a time, but it's still small enough to fit in my refridgerator. Round containers are better than square ones since then you won't need to scoop dough out of the corners. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cambro-RFS6PP190-Camwear-6-Quart-Container/dp/B07MVJNXL9">this 6qt Cambro container</a>.
